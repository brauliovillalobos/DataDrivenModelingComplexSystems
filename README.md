Data-Driven Modeling of Complex Systems (DDMCS) (https://walterquattrociocchi.site.uniroma1.it/teaching/data-driven-modeling-of-complex-systems)

Professor: PhD. Walter Quattrociocchi (https://walterquattrociocchi.site.uniroma1.it/home)

The course introduces advanced topics of networks science and diffusion models and, thanks to the complex systems approach, it aims to extract knowledge from data by exploiting a complexity-driven (e.g., dynamic processes on complex networks) approach.

In the first part, it explores the foundational aspects and advanced topics of complex systems (multilayer networks, percolation, time-varying graphs), while in the second part, it applies those concepts to state-of-the-art cases on massive datasets, ranging from the effect of feed algorithms on social dynamics up to patterns of human mobility, passing through information operations, and bot detection.
